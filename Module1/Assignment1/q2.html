<!-- Given the above html, find out what happens when you try to access the element h1 in
javascript (using document.getElementById) and change its content to “Goodbye World”
when the script is attached:
● in the head tag
● at the start of the body tag
● at the end of the body tag -->

<html>
<head>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("test").textContent = "Changed Hello, World!";
        // The above line will throw an error because the script is executed before the DOM is fully loaded.
        // This will throw an error: Uncaught TypeError: Cannot set properties of null (setting 'textContent')
    </script>
</head>
    <body>
        <script>
            document.getElementById("test").textContent = "Changed Hello, World!";
            // The above line will throw an error because the script is executed before the DOM is fully loaded.

        <h1 id="test">Hello World!</h1>

        <script>

            // This line will work because the DOM is fully loaded by this point.
