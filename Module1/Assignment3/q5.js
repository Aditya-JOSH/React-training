// Can you use return instead of break in loops?

// Yes, you can use return inside loopsâ€”but only inside a function.
// break
// Used to exit a loop early, before its condition is false.

// Works in for, while, and switch statements.

// return
// Used to exit a function and optionally return a value.

// If used inside a loop that is inside a function, it will exit both the loop and the function.
